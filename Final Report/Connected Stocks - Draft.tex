\begin{abstract}
We connect stocks by their common blockholders. We introduce a measure that captures the extent to which distribution of joint holders. A vital feature of the measure is allowing the joint ownership distributions to affect the measure. After that, We show that the degree of shared ownership that crosses a threshold forecasts return correlation, controlling for exposure to systematic return factors and other pair characteristics. We study this effect in business groups and find that being in the same business group significantly affects comovement. Further investigations explain that comovement increases when a bank is a business group's ultimate owner.

\section{Data and Methodology}



\subsection{Data and Sample}


We gathered industries index and stock returns, trading volume, and other relevant market and accounting data from the Codal website \footnote{\href{http://www.codal.ir}{www.codal.ir}}
 and the  Tehran Securities Exchange Technology Management Co (TSETMC)\footnote{\href{http://www.tsetmc.com}{www.tsetmc.com}} database.
We also use our unique data set, including the daily ownership table that reports all end-of-the-days block-holders of listed firms with their changes in that day.  Block-holder is a shareholder who owns at least 1\% of the total shares outstanding. 

  We exclude ETFs from our listed firms because it has a different return and ownership patterns compared to other firms in our study.
We restrict our empirical analysis to 2015/03-2020/03(1394/01-1398/12 Persian calendar) due to the availability of daily ownership data and the special events \footnote{
The Tehran Stock Exchange's main index (TEPIX) raised exponentially to quadruple value and then fell sharply due to the gigantic entrance of new individual investors that seems to be a bubble period from that period.} that happened after 2020/03, which may affect our results. 
  
  
  
  Business groups - groups of listed firms with interconnected ownership structures controlled by an ultimate common owner - are the principal organizational structure in many parts of the world.
  Business groups seem to be a central feature of corporate ownership in Iran. 
  Most Iranian listed firms present in a complex interlinked shareholders' network that an ultimate owner governs this group through many layers of ownership.{\cite{Aliabadi2022}}  
We do not have pre-specified Iranian business groups despite other countries like South Korea, Japan, and India that their groups are announced formally.
For defining business groups, we use data provided by {\cite{Aliabadi2022}}.
They use \cite{almeida2011structure} algorithm with a 40\% threshold for defining groups. 


Table \ref{t2-1} reports summary statistics of ownership data and business groups. As shown in the table, 494 firms on average have five block-holders that own 73 percent of them. There are 43 business groups on average, with seven members which own 314 (63\%) firms.

\subsection{Pair composition }

  If two firms have at least one common block-holder, We consider them as a pair. By this definition, there are 9336  unique pairs in entire periods, which is 18\% of possible pairs (597*596/2 = 177906). As we expected, stocks in pairs have concentrated ownership relative to the total sample, and pairs have one common owner.
  
  \normalcolor
  
As one of our empirical studies, we study the impact of being in the same business group relative to being in two distinct groups on pair's correlation. (Further explanations about business groups are in section \ref{BGDef} )
   For assigning one pair to a group, both firms should belong to one ultimate owner. Another possibility is that each firm belongs to a different ultimate owner or one of them, or both of them do not belong to any groups, which all of them illustrated in figure \ref{g2-1}.
    By classifying pairs, on average, 15\% of them  belong to one business group, and 74\% of them are not in the same business groups  each year. We report summary statistics of ownership features for all pairs in table \ref{t2-2}.

\subsection{Stock Return comovement}
\label{comovement}

We calculate the monthly correlation of each pair from stocks' daily abnormal returns. Benchmark for calculating abnormal return is the following equation which is a four-factor model plus industry return due to the importance of industries on stocks' return in the Tehran stock exchange (TSE) :
\begin{equation}
 \begin{split}
   R_{i,t} =\alpha _{i}&+\beta _{mkt,i}{\mathit {R}}_{M,t} + \beta_{Ind,i}{\mathit {R}}_{Ind,t} + \\
  &+\beta _{HML,i}{\mathit {HML}}_{t}+\beta _{SMB,i}{\mathit {SMB}}_{t}+\beta _{UMD,i}{\mathit {UMD}}_{t}+ \varepsilon_{i,t}
  \end{split}
     \label{e5Factor}
\end{equation}
where $ R_{i,t} $, $ R_{M,t} $ and $ R_{Ind,t} $ are excess daily return of respectivly  firm, market and firm's industry from bank deposit's daily rate(risk free). Other variabales difinition is base on Carhart four-factor model [\cite{Carhart4Factor}].

At the end of each month, we estimate our benchmark model base on the past three-month period (from two months before the end of the preceding month) and measure daily residuals.  After that, we calculate the monthly correlation of daily residuals during that month for the pair.

We use other benchmarks for calculating a monthly correlation and report its summary in table \ref{tCorr}. 
As we expected,  models that include industry returns remove pairs' correlation. According to the results, it seems that our selected benchmark (4 Factor + Industry) almost captures all the pairs' comovement because it is nearly a zero mean variable. We use these correlations for our analysis.

         }
      \end{table}
      

\FloatBarrier
\subsection{Controls}
We are interested in the effects of common ownership on pair's comovement.
Our prediction of a higher correlation for a higher level of common ownership dominates by stocks' intrinsic similarity, and these similarities motivate block-holders to hold these stocks simultaneously. These related stocks will comove regardless of who owns them.

The first group of controls is pair controls. These controls include
a dummy variable for whether two stocks are in the same industry, \textbf{SameIndustry}; a dummy variable for whether two stocks are in the same business group, \textbf{SameGroup}. As shown in table \ref{SameGroupIndustry}, 10\% and 6\%  of pairs are in the same industry and business group. Furthermore, we control for cross-ownership between two stocks and define  \textbf{CrossOwnership} as the maximum percent of cross-ownership between two firms in the following month.


\begin{table}[htbp]
\caption{\scriptsize This table reports the number of pairs in the same industry and business group.}

         {
\input{SameGroupSameIndustry.tex}
                 }
             \end{table}


Another group of controls are firm-specific controls.  We define these variables base on  \cite{AntonPolk} methodology. One of these is size control based on the normalized rank-transform of the percentile market capitalization of the two stocks, \textbf{Size1} and \textbf{Size2} (where we label the
larger stock in the pair as the first stock). The other one is a book to market ratio based on the normalized rank-transform of the percentile book to market of the two stocks, \textbf{BookToMarket1} and \textbf{BookToMarket2}.
We also control these characteristics on a pair level. Our measures of similarity, \textbf{SameSize}, and \textbf{SameBookToMarket}, are the negative of the absolute difference in percentile ranking for a particular characteristic across a pair.


We calculate our controls daily and then report the average of these variables for the entire period at the end of each month. Table \ref{ControlsSummary} shows the summary statistics of specified controls in this section.

\subsection{Measurement of cross-ownership}


In table \ref{maasurmentsSummary} we summarize common ownership measurements which are used in literature. There are two groups of measurement for common ownership.
First of all, model-based measures that capture common ownership base on a proper  model. These measures have a better economic interpretation, but most of them are bi-directional or industry-level measures.(e.g, \cite{harford2011institutional}; \cite{azar2018anticompetitive}; \cite{gilje2020s})

In addition to model-based measures, some ad hoc common ownership measures are used in the empirical literature. There is significant doubt on how these measures capture common ownership's impact on the management, and many of them have unappealing properties.(e.g, \cite{AntonPolk}; \cite{azar2011new}; \cite{freeman2019effects}; \cite{hansen1996externalities};  \cite{he2017product}; \cite{he2019internalizing}; \cite{lewellen2021does}; \cite{newham2018common})

In our primary analysis, we estimate the impact of common ownership on pair's correlation. For this purpose, we need a pair-level measure with a good economic interpretation that is not bi-directional. As a result, we propose a modification for Anton's measure (\cite{AntonPolk}) that captures the extent of common ownership distribution and apply this measure in this study.

\subsubsection{Modified Anton's measure }
We reformulate mentioned Anton's measure in table \ref{maasurmentsSummary}. This factor measure common ownership as the total value of
stock held by the F common-holders of the two stocks, scaled by the total market capitalization of the two stocks
\begin{equation}
	\text{Overlap}_{Sum}(i, j) = \frac{\sum_{f = 1}^{F} (S^f_{i,t}P_{i,t}+S^f_{j,t}P_{j,t})}{S_{i,t}P{i,t} + S_{j,t}P{j,t}}
	\label{Sum}
\end{equation}
where $ S^f_{i,t}$ is the number of shares held by owner f
at time t trading at price $ P{i,t} $ with total shares outstanding of $ S_{i,t} $, and similarly for stock j. 
As shown in equation \ref{Sum}, this measure neglects different distribution of common owners and represents the percent of joint-held market capitalization from the total market capitalization of the two stocks.

We reweight this formula to capture the difference between ownership distribution. Our proposed measures are shown in equation \ref{sqrt} and \ref{Quadratic} where all variables as the same Anton's measure. Both modified measures represent the number of equal percents held block-holder. In other words, If for a pair of stocks with n mutual owners, all owners have even shares of each firm's market cap, then the proposed indexes will be equal to number of holders.\footnote{ \tiny
	Each holder owns $ 1/n $ of each firm ,Firm's market cap is $ \alpha_1 $ and $ \alpha_2 $, So for each holder of firms we have $ S^f_{i,t}P_{i,t} = \alpha_i/n $\\
	$
	[  \frac{\sum_{f=1}^{n} \sqrt{\alpha_1/n}+\sum_{f=1}^{n} \sqrt{\alpha_2/n}}{\sqrt{\alpha_1} + \sqrt{\alpha_2}}]^2 
	= [\frac{\sqrt{n}(\sqrt{\alpha_1} +\sqrt{\alpha_2 })}{\sqrt{\alpha_1} + \sqrt{\alpha_2}}]^2 = n $
	\\
	$
	[\frac{\sum_{f=1}^{n} {(\alpha_1/n)^2}+\sum_{f=1}^{n} {(\alpha_2/n)^2}}{\alpha_1^2 +{\alpha_2}^2}]^{-1} = [\frac{{\alpha_1^2 + \alpha_2^2 }}{n(\alpha_1^2 + \alpha_2^2)}]^{-1} = n
	$
}



\begin{equation}
	\text{Overlap}_{Sqrt}(i, j) =  [\frac{\sum_{f =1}^{F}(\sqrt{S^f_{i,t}P_{i,t}}+\sqrt{S^f_{j,t}P_{j,t}})}{\sqrt{S_{i,t}P{i,t}} + \sqrt{S_{j,t}P{j,t}}}]^2 
	\label{sqrt}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
	\text{Overlap}_{Quadratic}(i, j) =  [{\frac{\sum_{f = 1}^{F}[(S^f_{i,t}P_{i,t})^2+(S^f_{j,t}P_{j,t})^2]}{(S_{i,t}P{i,t})^2 + (S_{j,t}P{j,t})^2}}]^{-1}
	\label{Quadratic}
\end{equation}

There are some numeric examples for better comparison. Two firms (X and Y) have one common owner who has $ \alpha $ and $ \beta $ from each market capitalization, respectively. (illustrated in figure \ref{gExample1}) 
for better illustration, assume that the sum of holder's ownership equal to 100 percent ($ \alpha + \beta  = 100$), and two firms' market cap is equal.

We  calculate common ownership measures base on equations \ref{Sum} (Sum), \ref{sqrt} (SQRT), and \ref{Quadratic} (Quadratic) for different ownership distributions.  Figure \ref{example1Results}  reports calculations results. As we expected, Anton's measure is constant at a fixed level of aggregate common ownership, but SQRT and  Quadratic vary from concentrated to dispersed ownership.  Concentrated ownership (50-50) has a greater common ownership measure than dispersed (10-90).

\end{figure}


Now assume that there are three common owners for the two mentioned firms. First holder's ownership from firm X and Y are respectively $\alpha_1$ and $\beta_1$. It is similar for other holders. (illustrated in figure \ref{gExample2}). As before, the firm's market cap is equal. We calculate measures for concentrated or disparate ownership and ownerships that are less than the aggregate of the firm's market cap. Table \ref{Example2} reports calculation results. For ownerships that consist of total market cap,  results are consistent with the first example. Although, when aggregate ownership decreases, the Quadratic measure denotes unrealistic numbers. We conclude that our Quadratic measure is not a good measure for common ownership.

A fundamental assumption in previous examples is equality of firms' market cap. In the last example, we relax this assumption. Table \ref{marketcap} reports calculated measures for fixed aggregate ownership on different relative market cap ratios. We extend our analysis to higher market cap ratios and report our results in figure \ref{sqrtMarket} and \ref{sumMarket}. In this setting, the SQRT measure has a better variation relative to Anton's measure.

In conclusion, We use the SQRT measure for our main study. This measure has an acceptable variation within different distributions and relative market caps. Also, it has a fair value at a lower level of aggregate common ownership. 

On each day, we measure common ownership by SQRT measure and then report an average of these daily calculations for the entire period at the end of each month. We also calculate Anton's measure in this way. Table \ref{measureResults} report snapshots of the distribution of
common ownership measure for both methods. As we expected, the modified measure creates higher values for a high level of common ownership than Anton's measure. The average common ownership measure is five and three times larger, respectively, in business groups and industries.

\subsection{Overview of Business Groups in Tehran Stock Exchange} \label{BGDef}

There is no difference between emerging markets (such as  Chile, India, Indonesia, South Korea, Pakistan, and many more) and developed ones (like Italy and Sweden); business groups present everywhere. However, group-affiliated firms are relatively large and economically important in emerging markets. 
These groups principally consist of legally independent firms grouped by persistent formal (e.g., equity) and informal (e.g., family) links.(\cite{Khanna2007}) 
There is a complex ownership network in TSE as an emerging market. 
This complicated ownership creates a vast number of business groups in which an ultimate owner controls them through a multi-layer of ownership. (\cite{FirmInterlock})

The reason for many of these business groups back to the 1979 revolution. After the revolution, due to social sentiment, critical sectors of the economy nationalized, and their ownership transferred to the government or other pseudo-government foundations. Also,
some other groups of firms in heavy industries were established and controlled by the Industrial Development and Renovation Organization (IDRO) during the 1960s and 1970s.  (IDRO was a state-owned holding company for investing in capital-intensive industries) 

The business groups are formed from mentioned ancestors due to two related forces; A multi-phased privatization by the state and the development of the domestic stock market. In the first wave of privatization, more than 300 companies were fully or partially privatized. In the second one, approximately  \$150 billion ownership of State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) and assets were transferred.  
Pension funds, military institutions, cultural and religious foundations, and revolutionary foundations (pseudo-government groups) primary customers in the second wave of privatization. These waves of privatization transferred control of hundreds of SOEs to
semi-governmental groups and were the main driver of the formation of business groups in Iran. In addition, the developing stock market from the early 2000s enhances this effect. The government tried to develop the stock market as a tool for better privatization. 
(\cite{Aliabadi2022})

In conclusion, the multiple waves of privatization with the development of the stock market changed ownership structure in pre-revolutionary holding companies and post-revolutionary foundations. They created large business groups that govern primary industries. As a result, we expect that pairs in the business groups belong to the same sector, and figure \ref{sameIndustryinBG} confirms that. As you can see, only 8\% of our pairs belong to the same industry, but 43\% of pairs in the same group are in the same industry. Pairs in the business groups are the same size and book to market as other pairs. However, as said before, the common ownership level in these pairs is much greater, and cross-ownership is higher in business group pairs. Figure \ref{BGSummary} reports an average of control variables in these two types of groups.

\section{Results}

\subsection{Forecasting Co-movement}

Our specific interest is how the common ownership affects a pair of stocks return co-movement. As it has shown in figure \ref{mcorr50}, a higher level of common ownership in the current period is associated with a higher level of correlation in the following month. We empirically test the impact of current measured common ownership on the next period's co-movement.

 \begin{figure}[htbp]
 \centering  
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{"mcorr50.eps"} 
    \caption{Future monthly correlation for different level of common ownership at this period }
    \label{mcorr50}
\end{figure}

For this purpose, we estimate the cross-sectional regressions forecasting within-month realized correlation ($\rho_{i,j,t+1}$) of each pair of stocks abnormal return. By abnormal return, we mean daily four-factor plus industry residuals of estimated model (Specific details and reasons for using this model described in the section \ref{comovement}). We use $\textit{FCA}^*_{ij,t}$, $\textit{SameGroup}_{ij} $, and their interaction for our main analysis and other pair characteristics as controls:
\input{Model11}

We estimate these regressions for each month and report the time-series average as in \cite{FamaMacBeth} to don't have any problem with cross-correlation in the residuals. We then use  \cite{newey1987hypothesis} to calculate standard errors of the Fama-MacBeth that take into account autocorrelation in the time series of cross-sectional estimates for four lags ($ 4(60/100)^{\frac{2}{9}} = 3.57 \sim 4 $). Furthermore, we use the current period's co-movement to control other committed variables that depend on the pair's characteristics which we cannot measure. 

Table \ref{mresult2} shows that results from forecasting cross-sectional variation in pair's co-movement. In the first two columns, we estimate a simplified version of equation \ref{model1} with only the \textit{Same Group} as an independent variable. In the first column, we estimate the model without control variables. Recall that our control variables are \textit{Same Industry}, \textit{Same Size}, \textit{Same Book to Market}, \textit{Cross-Ownership}, and the current realized correlation ($\rho_{i,j,t}$). The \textit{Same Size} and the \textit{Same Book to Market} are normalized to have a standard deviation of one and are transformed so that higher values indicate greater style similarity. We find that the \textit{Same Group} has a highly statically significant effect, with a coefficient of $0.0128$ and a t-statistic of $6.29$, in the presence of control variables. 
In columns three and four, we estimate our simplified model with only common ownership, $\text{FCA}^*_{ij,t}$, as a forecasting variable. We find that $\text{FCA}^*_{ij,t}$ significantly improves our forecast, with a coefficient of $0.0038$ and a t-statistic of $5.12$, but the impact of the \textit{Same Group}   is three times bigger than this. 

In the fifth specification of table \ref{mresult2}, we use both \textit{Same Group}  and $\text{FCA}^*_{ij,t}$ as a forecasting variable. Both variables still have a significant effect on our estimation, and also, the $\textit{SameGroup}_{ij} $ still has a greater impact than common ownership in this specification. Furthermore, the sixth and final column of table \ref{mresult2}, include these interactions. We include the business group fixed effect to capture the group's characteristics for the last column. These results show that $\text{FCA}^*_{ij,t}$ has a larger effect for the pairs in the same business group. However, \textit{Same Group}  do not have a significant effect on our estimation. It suggests that the \textit{Same Group}  affects co-movement through indirect common ownership, which arises due to the same ultimate owner. On the other hand, as shown in figure \ref{BGSummary}, pairs in the same business group have a higher level of common ownership than others. This evidence imply that higher level

We extend our investigation in order to separate effect of business groups and common ownership by constructing all the pairs in the market. For this purpose, we include stocks in the one pair if they have, at least, two months in common. In this definition, we do not restrict our investigation to commonly hold stocks and set $\text{FCA}^*_{ij,t}$ to zero for two stocks that do not have any common owner.

Pairs of companies belonging to the same business group have a higher correlation than pairs not in the same group. In addition, Pairs that belong to the same group and have a common ownership co-move more than pairs that don't have common ownership.

Stock returns of group affiliated firms exhibit robustly positive comovement even after controlling for both market and industry effects. Group betas
($ \beta_{Businussgroup} $) are highly significant across all models.

\subsection{Comovement in Business Groups}
\FloatBarrier

\subsection{Evidence for correlated trading }

 
For each firm, we calculate daily institutional imbalances, which is the net buying value of institutional investors relative to total traded value on that day ($ \text{InsImb} = \frac{\text{Buy}_{\text{value}} - \text{Sell}_{\text{value}}}{\text{Buy}_{\text{value}} + \text{Sell}_{\text{value}}} $). 
We expect that institutional imbalances have a lower variation in groups due to the correlated tradings that the ultimate owner ordered to do. So, we calculate the monthly standard deviation of the group's imbalances and compare them to unaffiliated ones. As we expected grouped standard error is  13.1\% and significantly (with t-stat of 12.57) lower than ungrouped firms. 

\begin{table}[htbp]
	\centering
	\resizebox{0.75\textwidth}{!}{
		\input{ImbalanceSummary.tex}
	}
	\label{tab:ImbalanceSummary}%
\end{table}%
\begin{figure}[htbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{GroupedSTD}
	\label{fig:GroupedSTD}
\end{figure}

According to the main hypothesis, we need to compare comovement between pairs in groups with low standard error and other pairs.
For this purpose, we define \textbf{Low Imbalance std} dummy for groups whose average standard errors are lower than half of the sample. 
So, this dummy is equal to one if at least one pair's firms belong to the low imbalance std business group.
\begin{table}[htbp]
	\centering
	\resizebox{\textwidth}{!}{
		\input{Imbalance.tex}
	}
\end{table}
\FloatBarrier

Furthermore, we should show that stocks in groups have a similar daily trading behavior. Accordingly, for each firm we run time-series regressions of the firm's daily change in trading measure, $ \Delta \text{Measure}_{i,t} $, on changes in market measure,$ \Delta\text{Measure}_{Market,t}   $ , changes in the industry and business group portfolio's measure,$ \Delta\text{Measure}_{Ind,t} $ and  $\Delta \text{Measure}_{Group,t} $ and  ,as well as control variables.

We compute the daily change of measure by this definition $ \Delta \text{Measure}_{i,t} = \ln(\frac{\text{Measure}_{i,t}}{\text{Measure}_{i,t-1}}) $. 
We estimate the following regression for each stock across trading days and cross-sectional averages of the estimated coefficients are reported, with t-statistics in parentheses :

\begin{equation*}
	\begin{split}
		\Delta \text{Measure}_{i,t} =  & \text{	}\alpha + \beta_{Market,t} \Delta \text{Measure}_{Market,t}  
		+ \beta_{Ind,t} \Delta \text{Measure}_{Ind,t} \\ & + \beta_{Group,t} \Delta \text{Measure}_{Group,t} + \delta\text{Controls} + \varepsilon_{i,t}
	\end{split}
\end{equation*}

We use the turnover and Amihud measure as a daily trading measures separately. For turnover measure, we use size of the firm as a control variable and for Amihud, we include lead, lag, and contemporaneous market returns, contemporaneous firm return squared, and lead and lag changes in the two portfolio illiquidity measures.
