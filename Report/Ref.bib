This is also true for: (a) dividend initiations that are motivated by the exogenous 2003 dividend tax cut; and (b) the cash dividend share class of Citizens Utilities (relative to its stock dividend class). We find that flows to dividend prone (averse) mutual funds increase the comovement among dividend-paying (non-dividend paying) stocks. Overall, the evidence supports the proposition that the trading of pro-dividend (dividend-averse) clienteles induces an extra factor in dividend payers (non-payers), beyond those associated with changes in common factors.}

We take a closer look at four approaches used to identify these effects. We find that the effects that some studies have attributed to common ownership are caused by other factors, such as differential responses of firms (or industries) to the 2008 financial crisis. We propose a modification to one of the previously used empirical approaches that is less sensitive to these issues. Using this to re-evaluate the link between common ownership and firm outcomes, we find little robust evidence that common ownership affects firm behavior.}

We show that the degree of shared ownership forecasts cross-sectional variation in return correlation, controlling for exposure to systematic return factors, style and sector similarity, and many other pair characteristics. We argue that shared ownership causes this excess comovement based on evidence from a natural experiment—the 2003 mutual fund trading scandal. These results motivate a novel cross-stock-reversal trading strategy exploiting information contained in ownership connections. We show that long-short hedge fund index returns covary negatively with this strategy, suggesting these funds may exacerbate this excess comovement.},
