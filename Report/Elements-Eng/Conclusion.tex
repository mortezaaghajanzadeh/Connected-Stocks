\section{Conclusion}

	We show that stocks are connected through mutual ultimate owners they have in common. In particular, pairs of stocks that are linked through ultimate owners covary more than commonly hold firms. We distinguished the effect of the high level of common ownership and the same ultimate owner and confirmed that the same ultimate owner affects more than direct common ownership.
	When we talk about the presence of two stocks in the same business group, we talk about a high level of invisible common ownership between two stocks that we cannot measure that by mutual stockholders.
