\section{Conclusion}

Although the importance of blockholders in firm governance, the impact of common ownership of blockholders on the stock price comovement is relatively unexplored. This study investigates the effect of blockholder common ownership on commonality in stock prices. We find positive and significant comovement in stock return of with common ownership.

 We also examine the comovement of firms in the business groups which are linked through an ultimate owner. Our results indicate that firms in the business groups comove more than commonly held firms. Furthermore, we provide evidence that common ownership matters for the firms in the business groups. 

Finally, given that group-affiliated firms comove with each other,  we explore more about the source of this commonality by examining the correlated trades in group-affiliated firms. We find that the volume and direction of trades in group-affiliated firms are related, and firms in groups with higher relations in trade have a higher level of comovement.


When we talk about the presence of two stocks in the same business group, we talk about a high level of invisible common ownership between two stocks that we cannot measure that by mutual stockholders.
