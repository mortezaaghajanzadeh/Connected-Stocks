\section{Introduction}

The literature has well established that stocks move together. Risk models are becoming increasingly popular, especially after the financial crisis of 2008. According to these models, price correlation plays a significant role in risk measurement. Companies' return co-movement was traditionally attributed to their fundamentals. (Aamong all {\cite{shiller1989comovements}})
	
	Although, in recent years, it has been recognized that the co-movement rises from non-fundamental sources. {\cite{barberis2003style} and \cite{barberis2005comovement}} provided theoretical models for predicting a co-movement between fundamentally unrelated companies. Trying to explain factors affecting co-movement, {\cite{AntonPolk}} examined on the effect of common ownership\footnote{The common ownership concept has been observed in financial literature in recent years. There has been a surge in the popularity of index investing in the United States, which has led to an increase in common ownership. 
			For instance, \cite{azar2018anticompetitive} claims that an increase in mutual ownership in airline companies leads to less competitive ticket pricing. However, this subject is controversial and many papers discuss whether mutual ownership affects companies' behavior.
			For example, \cite{lewellen2021does} realized that in previous investigations, other effective factors have wrongly been replaced by mutual ownership effect.
		} on co-movement\footnote{	The followings are some of the other sources of co-movement. Index inclusion ({\cite{barberis2005comovement}}), investors' attention to the companies ({\cite{wu2014investor}}), Investment banks' underwriting ({\cite{grullon2014comovement}}), correlated beliefs ({\cite{david2016correlated}}), shareholders' coordination ({\cite{pantzalis2017shareholder}}), and preference for companies' dividends ({\cite{HAMEED2019103}}) are among contributing factors to co-movement that have been identified by researchers.}.	This paper uses the mutual funds' ownership and suggests that co-movement increases by increasing common ownership. Also, it is shown in the paper that the  co-movement increases when there is a significant net flow, either in or out-flow in the months.
	
	Subsequently, according to {\cite{Liquidity2016}} companies show co-movement considering their owners' correlation in their liquidity needs. The author also adds that companies with higher mutual fund ownership have a more liquidity correlation than others. This paper contends that in order for companies to have co-movement, there is no need for common ownership. Plus, common ownership can explain companies'  liquidity correlation. 
	
	While most of the prior investigations on factors affecting common-ownership have focused on the fund, the role of the block-holders as one the most important factors in firms' governance has remained a black box\footnote{A long literature surveyed by \cite{holderness2003survey}, \cite{edmans2014blockholders}, and \cite{edmans2017blockholders} considers the potential role of blockholders in firm governance}.  This type of owners perform particular types of behavior due to their needs and the fact that they are intermediates.
		Nevertheless, in Iran, the block holders' daily ownership data, including mutual fund ownership, is publicly accessible. So research through this data can show whether common ownership other than mutual fund ownership can lead to co-movement or not. Following \cite{AntonPolk}, we are the first study that uses block-holder ownership to investigate the relationship between common ownership and co-movement.
		
Despite the presence of the business group in both emerging economies, e.g., Brazil, Chile, China, India, Indonesia, South Korea, and developed countries, e.g., Italy, Sweden, (\cite{khanna2007business}), there is no evidence on whether being at the same business group can lead to the co-movement. Business groups consist of legally independent firms operating across diverse industries different from commonly held firms. Although researchers have identified co-movement among stock
returns,  to the best of our knowledge, we are the first comprehensive study about the different roles of the business groups and common ownership on co-movement.

%	Both {\cite{cho2015stock} and \cite{kim2015stock}} studied the South Korean market and suggested two different sources for the co-movement in business groups. The first paper attributed co-movement to the companies' fundamentals. However, the second paper presents that the investors' category/habitat behavior is responsible for co-movement.
%	
%	In this paper, we consider the co-movement of the companies in business groups. Best of our knowledge, it is the first study that compares direct and indirect common ownership.
%	A modified measurement is introduced in this paper to calculate the common ownership of the companies. 
	
	%% Result
	We realize that common ownership is crucial for predicting the co-movement. Business groups play a more critical role in predicting correlation of companies' return than common ownership. We show that common ownership  can predict  co-movement only inside  the business groups.
	We extend our analysis in order to validate the prominence of business groups. First, restrict the study to high level of common ownership for distinguishing effect of high level of common ownership and business groups. 
	In this subset, like the mentioned ones, business groups have a significant impact.
	Second, if business group affect co-movement, there is no need to restrict our investigation to commonly hold pairs. In order to distinguish the impact of common ownership and business group, we built all possible pairs in the market.
	We show that for all the firms in the market, business group can increase firms' co-movement. 
	
	Finally, we show that correlated trade in business groups is the channel of co-movement. We provide evidence that the volume and direction of trades in business groups are related, and firms in the business groups with higher relation in trade have a higher level of co-movement.
	
	
	%  The business groups might not have as much influence as the market has on many companies' turnover fluctuations. However, it is influential.
	% The companies' presence in business groups can explain the correlation in turnover. 
	% We extracted both yearly companies' turnover average and monthly market turnover from monthly companies' turnover. Then we realized that there is less monthly residual dispersion in business
	% groups analyzing the deduced data.
	% More co-movement is detected for groups with less dispersion.
	% 
	% Institutional imbalance:
	% Institutional imbalance dispersion must be low for these companies.
	% In general, the imbalance dispersion average in business groups is less than companies that are not included in the groups.
	% A more precise study illustrated that determining business groups with low dispersion, we expect the co-movement to increase.
	% In low dispersion groups, the co-movement increases with either a decrease in dispersion or with higher common ownership.
	% We searched for fundamental factors, too. But they had no impact on price co-movements.-
