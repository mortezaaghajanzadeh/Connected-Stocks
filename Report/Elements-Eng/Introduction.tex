\section{Introduction}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Existing literature has well established that stocks comove with each other. One collection of studies suggests that commonality in fundamental values generates comovement in stock return. This suggestion is derived from economics without frictions and rational investors. For example, \cite{shiller1989comovements} provides evidence that the comovement of real dividends could be accounted for the comovement in real stock prices.
	Although, in recent years, it has been recognized that the comovement rises from non-fundamental sources. {\cite{barberis2003style} and \cite{barberis2005comovement}} provided theoretical models for predicting a comovement between fundamentally unrelated companies. Trying to explain factors affecting comovement, {\cite{AntonPolk}} examined the effect of common ownership\footnote{The common ownership concept has been observed in financial literature in recent years. There has been a surge in the popularity of index investing in the United States, which has led to an increase in common ownership. 
			For instance, \cite{azar2018anticompetitive} claims that an increase in mutual ownership in airline companies leads to less competitive ticket pricing. However, this subject is controversial, and many papers discuss whether mutual ownership affects companies' behavior.
			For example, \cite{lewellen2021does} realized that in previous investigations, other effective factors have wrongly been replaced by the mutual ownership effect.
		} on comovement\footnote{	The followings are some of the other sources of comovement. Index inclusion ({\cite{barberis2005comovement}}), investors' attention to the companies ({\cite{wu2014investor}}), Investment banks' underwriting ({\cite{grullon2014comovement}}), correlated beliefs ({\cite{david2016correlated}}), shareholders' coordination ({\cite{pantzalis2017shareholder}}), and preference for companies' dividends ({\cite{HAMEED2019103}}) are among contributing factors to comovement that have been identified by researchers.}. This paper uses mutual funds' ownership and suggests that comovement increases by increasing common ownership. Also, it is shown in the paper that the comovement increases when there is a significant net flow, either in or out-flow in the months.
	
	Subsequently, according to {\cite{Liquidity2016}} companies show comovement considering their owners' correlation in their liquidity needs. The author also adds that companies with higher mutual fund ownership have a more liquidity correlation than others. This paper contends that in order for companies to have comovement, there is no need for common ownership. Plus, common ownership can explain companies'  liquidity correlation. 
	
While most of the prior investigations on factors affecting common-ownership have focused on the fund, the role of the block-holders as one of the most important factors in firms' governance has remained a black box\footnote{A long literature surveyed by \cite{holderness2003survey}, \cite{edmans2014blockholders}, and \cite{edmans2017blockholders} considers the potential role of blockholders in firm governance}. Funds behave differently due to their needs and the fact that they are intermediates, making it difficult to generalize these results to other types of ownership. \cite{edmans2014governance} provide a theoretical model to investigate the implications of common ownership of block holders for corporate governance and asset pricing. Nevertheless, in Iran, the block holders' daily ownership data, including mutual fund ownership, is publicly accessible. So research through this data can show whether common ownership other than mutual fund ownership can lead to comovement or not. Following \cite{AntonPolk}, we are the first study that uses block-holder ownership to investigate the relationship between common ownership and comovement.
	
	

		
Despite the presence of the business group in both emerging economies, e.g., Brazil, Chile, China, India, Indonesia, South Korea, and developed countries, e.g., Italy, Sweden, (\cite{khanna2007business}), there is no evidence on whether being at the same business group can lead to the comovement. Business groups consist of legally independent firms operating across diverse industries different from commonly held firms. Although researchers have identified comovement among stock
returns,  to the best of our knowledge, we are the first comprehensive study about the different roles of the business groups and common ownership on comovement.

%	Both {\cite{cho2015stock} and \cite{kim2015stock}} studied the South Korean market and suggested two different sources for the comovement in business groups. The first paper attributed comovement to the companies' fundamentals. However, the second paper presents that the investors' category/habitat behavior is responsible for comovement.
%	
%	In this paper, we consider the comovement of the companies in business groups. Best of our knowledge, it is the first study that compares direct and indirect common ownership.
%	A modified measurement is introduced in this paper to calculate the common ownership of the companies. 


We hypothesize that stocks with a high level of common ownership and the same ultimate owner exhibit strong comovement. In fact, when we talk about the presence of two stocks in the same business group, we talk about a high level of invisible common ownership between two stocks that we cannot measure by common ownership measurements. 

%% Result
We test this hypothesis using \cite{AntonPolk} methodology and realize that common ownership is crucial for predicting the comovement. Business groups play a more critical role in predicting the correlation of companies' returns than common ownership, with a coefficient about six times as large as the common ownership coefficient. Furthermore, We show that common ownership can predict comovement only inside the business groups.



We extend our analysis to validate the prominence of business groups. First, we find that the average of common ownership is five times larger for the firms in the business group. So, we restrict the study to the high level of common ownership to distinguish the effect of common ownership and business groups. In this subsample, like the mentioned ones, business groups significantly impact firms' comovement. Second, if business groups affect comovement, there is no need to restrict our investigation to firms with common owners, and also this would affect all the firms in the market. To address these concerns and distinguish the impact of common ownership and business group, we extend our investigation to all the firms in the market and show that the business group can increase firms' comovement. 
	
	\hl{Finally, we investigate different sources of business groups' comovement. We show that correlated trade in business groups is the channel of comovement. We provide evidence that the volume and direction of trades in business groups are related, and firms in the business groups with higher relation in trade have a higher level of comovement.}
	
	%  The business groups might not have as much influence as the market has on many companies' turnover fluctuations. However, it is influential.
	% The companies' presence in business groups can explain the correlation in turnover. 
	% We extracted both yearly companies' turnover average and monthly market turnover from monthly companies' turnover. Then we realized that there is less monthly residual dispersion in business
	% groups analyzing the deduced data.
	% More comovement is detected for groups with less dispersion.
	% 
	% Institutional imbalance:
	% Institutional imbalance dispersion must be low for these companies.
	% In general, the imbalance dispersion average in business groups is less than companies that are not included in the groups.
	% A more precise study illustrated that determining business groups with low dispersion, we expect the comovement to increase.
	% In low dispersion groups, the comovement increases with either a decrease in dispersion or with higher common ownership.
	% We searched for fundamental factors, too. But they had no impact on price comovements.-
