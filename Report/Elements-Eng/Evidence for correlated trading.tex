\section{{Evidence for correlated trading} }


	In the previous sections, we have provided evidence consistent with the hypothesis that the presence of firms in the business groups can raise firms' co-movement. Although we don't have definitive insight into the specific channel that business groups can promote commonality, our analysis provides a useful overview.
	We claim that this relationship exists because the business group is an important proxy for the likelihood that trading in these stocks will be correlated. To better understand how the business group can generate co-movement in firms' returns, we now refine our basic analysis to consider other proxy measures for business group trading.
	We employ two proxies for business group trading that are designed to capture different trading motivations: turnover and institutional imbalance. While the first could be due to buying or selling of business groups, the latter reflects buying.
%	We employ one proxy for business group trading that is designed to capture  trading motivations: turnover which could be due to buying or selling of business groups.



\subsection{{Turnover}}


	First, we should show that stocks in groups have a similar daily trading behavior. Accordingly, We use the turnover measure as a daily trading measures. For each firm we run time-series regressions of the firm's daily change in turnover, $ \Delta \text{TurnOver}_{i,t} $, on changes in market turnover,$ \Delta\text{TurnOver}_{Market,t}   $ , changes in the industry and business group portfolio's turnover,$ \Delta\text{TurnOver}_{Ind,t} $ and  $\Delta \text{TurnOver}_{Group,t} $ and  ,as well as control variables.
	We compute the daily change of turnover by this definition $ \Delta \text{TurnOver}_{i,t} = \ln(\frac{\text{TurnOver}_{i,t}}{\text{TurnOver}_{i,t-1}}) $. 
	We estimate the following regression for each stock across trading days in a given year separately, and cross-sectional averages of the estimated coefficients are reported, with t-statistics in parentheses :
	
		\input{Elements/turnoverModel}
	  We control for lead and lag changes in the two portfolios and the firm's measures and size. We estimate that model with \cite{FamaMacBeth} method and adjust its standard errors with \cite{newey1987hypothesis} for seven periods.  As shown in Table \ref{turnover}, firms' change in turnover comes from market reaction and group's change (This result is robust to the different methods of weighting for portfolios). This observation shows that firms in one group trade together each day. 
	
	We use our previous methodology to investigate these results. We calculate correlation of $ \Delta \text{TurnOver} $ for founded pairs and examine its relation with our variables. Table \ref{mresult2-turnover} reports the estimation result, which confirms that pairs in the business groups lead to correlated trade. In addition, we study effect of  correlation of $ \Delta \text{TurnOver} $ on co-movement for founded pairs in table \ref{turncomovement}. These results suggest that business groups yield to future co-movement through correlated trading in that month.

Furthermore, we have to directly show that firms with a higher level of group turnover have a higher level of co-movement. So, we extract the annual average level of firms and monthly turnover for each month. We assume that the residual of the model belongs to the business groups. We expect firms in the groups to have a lower dispersion in their residuals than firms out of the groups. We calculate firms' residuals by the mentioned hypothesis. Its summary stats is in table \ref{tab:ResidualTrunSummary}. As we expected, residuals in business groups have a lower dispersion than others.


We calculate the standard error of firms' monthly turnover residuals in each business group. Groups' standard errors description is shown in table \ref{tab:ResidualTrunStdSummary} and time series in in figure \ref{fig:GroupedResSTD}. On average, the affiliated firms' standard error is lower than unaffiliated ones. For finding the relation between the standard error of monthly turnover residuals, we define a dummy variable for groups in the low level of standard error, which is lower than the median. For analysis, we restrict our investigations to a subsample of \textit{Same Group} and others and estimate our desired variable.   For further study, we use the interaction of \textit{Same Group} with our dummy variable for the full sample, which confirmed our prior results. As shown in table \ref{Turnovercrosssection}, pairs in the business groups of low dispersion have a higher level of co-movement than other firms.

\subsection{{Institutional Imbalance}}

	We should show that stocks in groups that trade together are traded in the same direction. So, for each firm, we calculate daily institutional imbalances, which is the net buying value of institutional investors relative to total traded value on that day ($ \text{InsImb} = \frac{\text{Buy}_{\text{value}} - \text{Sell}_{\text{value}}}{\text{Buy}_{\text{value}} + \text{Sell}_{\text{value}}} $ [\cite{seasholes2007predictable}]).
		We expect that institutional imbalances have a lower variation in groups due to the correlated tradings that the ultimate owner ordered to do. So, we calculate monthly institutional imbalances for firms at the first step. As we expected, firms in the business groups have a lower level of standard error in  imbalances (Table\ref{tab:ImbalanceInsMeanSummary}). Then, we calculate the monthly standard deviation of the group's imbalances and compare them to unaffiliated ones. The standard error is  $12.2\%$ and significantly (with a p-value of 0) lower than ungrouped firms.

	According to the main hypothesis, we need to compare pairs in groups with low standard error and other pairs. For this purpose, we define \textbf{Low Imbalance std} dummy for groups whose average standard errors are lower than half of the sample. So, this dummy is equal to one if at least one pair's firms belong to the low imbalance std business group. We expect pairs in the same business groups with a low standard imbalance error to comove more than others. Table \ref{Imbalance} reports estimation results and confirms that pairs in the low imbalance std comove greater than others.
