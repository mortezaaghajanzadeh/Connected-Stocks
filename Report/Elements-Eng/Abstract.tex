 We link stocks through direct and indirect common owners, and we show that having common ownership and belonging to a business group (indirect common owner) affect the co-movement. Our analysis is based on the daily ownership of blockholders on the Tehran Stock Exchange. The study found that belonging to a business group had more impact than being a common owner, and a common owner influenced only movement within business groups. In addition, co-movement in business groups is explained by simultaneous trades in the same direction.
