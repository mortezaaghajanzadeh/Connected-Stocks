 We link stocks through direct and indirect common owners, showing that common ownership and belonging to a business group (indirect common owner) affect the stock price co-movement. Our analysis is based on the daily ownership of block-holders on the Tehran Stock Exchange. We show that belonging to a business group has a higher effect than having a common owner, which influenced only movement within business groups. In addition, simultaneous trades in the same direction explain comovement in business groups.
