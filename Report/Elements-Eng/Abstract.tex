Using a unique stock ownership dataset with daily frequency from Iran, we study the impact of direct and indirect common ownership on stock return comovements. While being part of the same business group is a main driver of common ownership among firms listed on Tehran Stock Exchange, it can also be regarded as indirect common ownership if two firms with no direct common owner are controlled by an ultimate owner in the same business group. We find that common ownership and business group affiliation are both positively associated with higher stock return comovement, but the impac tof business group affiliation is economically larger and statistically more significant. Furthermore, we show that simultaneous trades in the same direction explains stock price comovement among firms in the same business groups.
