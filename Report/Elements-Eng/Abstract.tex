We link stocks through direct and indirect common owners, and show that common ownership and business group affiliation (indirect common ownership) affect the stock price co-movement. Our analysis is based on the daily ownership of block-holders on the Tehran Stock Exchange, and we show that business group affiliation has a higher effect on stockâ€™s co-movement than having a common owner. Furthermore, we show that simultaneous trades in the same direction can explain stock price co-movement in the business groups.
