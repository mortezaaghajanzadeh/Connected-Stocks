Using a unique stock ownership dataset with daily frequency from Iran, we study the impact of direct and indirect common ownership on stock return comovements. While being part of the same business group is a main driver of common ownership among firms listed on Tehran Stock Exchange, it can also be regarded as indirect common ownership if two firms with no direct common owner are controlled by the same ultimate owner in a business group. We find that common ownership and business group affiliation are both positively associated with higher stock return comovement, but the impact of being part of the same business group seems to dominate that of direct common ownership. Further analyses show simultaneous trades in the same direction in business groups explains higher return comovements among stocks affiliated with the same business groups.
